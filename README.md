# Expression Evaluator

This project is an expression evaluator that handles mathematical expressions in infix notation, converts them to postfix notation, and evaluates them using both postfix and expression tree methods.

## Features

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion**: Converts infix expressions to postfix notation.
- **Expression Tree Evaluation**: Builds and evaluates expressions using a binary tree.
- **Postfix Evaluation**: Evaluates expressions directly in postfix notation.
- **Error Handling**: Handles division by zero and invalid expressions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- GitHub Desktop (for uploading and managing the repository)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use GitHub Desktop or clone via terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
    cd your-repo-name

3. **Compile the Project**
    javac src/pxu230006/ExpressionEvaluator.java

4. **Run the project**:
    java -cp src pxu230006.ExpressionEvaluator

## Usage:
        Input: The program reads expressions from a file or standard input.
        Output: It prints the infix expression, its postfix conversion, and the evaluation results.
